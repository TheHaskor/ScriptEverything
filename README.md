# ScriptEverything
open source platform defining cool behaviors via shell command.


The idea:
 1) user is accessing the ScriptEverything platform (hotkey - shift+s+e):
    convert_func(format=mp3 output=C:/temp)
 
 2) shell is open. code is taken from the url and being executed:
    shell: 'function_foo' is starting.
            convering video to format 'mp3'  
            file saved
    
 * In the platform we can define any behavior that we want (in function form) and execute it easily.
